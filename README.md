# CSV and Tab Delimited File Upload and Parse

Thanks to this <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/396-importing-csv-and-excel">RailsCasts</a> for giving me a pretty good starting point.

Run these commands to try it out.

```
clone project
bundle
rake db:setup
rails s
visit your localhost
```
sign in with email: "admin@example.com" and password: "password" or register a new account with the "sign up" link.

Two sample files have been included: `example_data.csv` and `example_data.tab`.

Requires Ruby 1.9.2 or later to run.
